# Ping Pong Game ðŸŽ®
Ping Pong is a simple game that simulates the classic table tennis experience. Players control a paddle to hit the ball and score points when the ball passes their opponent's paddle. The game is developed for both learning and entertainment purposes.
## Features
- Paddle control using keyboard.
- Score points when the opponent misses the ball.
- Simple yet engaging graphical interface.
- Support for two-player.
## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Run the `main.py` file to begin.
2. **Paddle Control**:
   - The left player uses the `W` and `S` keys to move their paddle up and down.
   - The right player uses the up and down arrow keys to move their paddle.
3. **Scoring**: The ball will move between the two paddles. You need to control your paddle to hit the ball; if the ball passes your opponent's paddle, you score a point.
